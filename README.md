# **S220**
#### *Semester 1, 2023* 

The purpose of this repo is to:
* Allow this individual to pass S220
* Serve as a platform to learn the basics of Github

Do not expect great things from this repo as:
1) It is an experiment and will likely be abandoned upon the completion of aforementioned paper 
2) It is one of the first times I have used this functionality and thus will not be groundbreaking
